# GaelGo Log — 2026-01-28

- Project folder created: C:\Users\ferna\clawd\Baco
- Preference: focus on system reasoning and process over exact code.
- Requested continuous project log.
- Initial scope: simple theater seat reservation app + web.
- Pivot: fixed-price travel packages app + web (Dublin, 200/300/400 EUR). GitHub‑ready, real problem, simple scope.
- Decision: confirm travel packages idea and proceed.
- Defined logical wireframes for app + web (MVP).
- Generated seed package data (Dublin, EUR, 2–5 nights).
- Translated seed data keys/values to English.
- Documented system flow (app/web ↔ API ↔ DB).
- Verified presence of Dublin holiday/package competitors (OTAs).
- User preference: always respond in English.
- Decision: focus on Dublin departures + fixed prices.
- Added competition + differentiation and product statement to README.
